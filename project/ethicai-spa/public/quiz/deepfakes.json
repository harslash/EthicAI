            "question": "How can deepfake technology create content?",
            "correct_answer": "With a generative adversarial network (GAN) that uses algorithms to train itself to recognize patterns",

                "Editing together various audio or video clips",

                "They can't"
            ],
            "explanation": "While there are many algorithms that can be used for deepfakes, a GAN uses algorithms to train itself to recognize patterns, which helps it learn the real characteristics needed to produce fake media. After lots of training, GAN output can be very hard to distinguish from real media."

                "Creation of fake news and disinformation",

            ],
            "explanation": "There is growing concern about deepfakes, especially as the technology becomes cheaper and easier to use. Deepfakes of politicians or elected officials can be used for fake news intended to lie to the public. Attackers can also use deepfakes for extortion to access money or confidential information. Deepfakes create a realistic likeness of a person, so they have also been used to ridicule, intimidate and harass others, and damage their reputation."

            "question": "How can you identify if a piece of media is a deepfake?",

                "Lip movements of the person look unnatural"

            "explanation": "As deepfake technology continues to improve over time, discerning between real and fake media can become increasingly difficult — but the deepfake artefacts above are helpful to look out for."

            ],
            "explanation": "A combination of deepfakes and disinformation/misinformation can hurt the credibility of legitimate sources through reports of misrepresentation and/or deception. If we are aware of highly sophisticated fake versions of media,we can’t trust that a real-looking piece of media truly is real."
